We failed a few times before considering that the shift may not apply to special characters. We were unsuccessful at finding the correct shift but we still believe it is a Caesar shift. |
| Aug 26 <br/> | 9:35pm-10:25pm | I kept trying different Caesar shift and tried a shift that loops around because of my belief that the first word was Twas. I then kept going with the shift and figured out the right number.         .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I started by wondering how I would shift back and forth from ascii to char values. Then, I figured that out and realized I need to shift each letter in that way so I would need a for loop. I tried a for-each loop which didn't work and settled on a regular one. Finally I spent quite some time analyzing how I would wrap the letters to complete Test 1. I tried subtraction before trying modulo and realized my method would differ based on cases. I then tried subtracting the A's of each case and adding them back plus the shift. That method worked and I completed riddle 1. |

First, I tried to see if there was a pattern in the differences between numbers. Then, I tried to see if it was a fibonacci series. Finally, I tried to see if there was a repetition of numbers since I saw many 32's. All attempts were unsuccessful. |

I researched how to split the string at each space because I figured I'd need that. I learned that using the split method and adding to an array would be simplest. I knew I would have to go through each number and then convert it to a character and used the parse int along with implicit declaration to do so. For riddle 3, I quickly realized it was binary so I began converting to decimal number for the first line. I then plugged the decimal value into the ascii table. After doing that for the first 3 decimal number, I realized that my method was correct. My first step in coding was deciding how to break the string into pieces of 8. I started by trying a counter variable in a for loop along with the modulo function but that caused out of bounds errors when I divided the string. So, I decided to use a for loop that went by 8's instead and added to an array (similar to riddle 2). I knew I'd have to go through each string in the array to convert it from string to binary, then binary to decimal, then decimal to character. Converting binary to decimal took some research and I learned I could use the parseInt function itself.

That failed so I moved on to see if the trucks could be spaces. I had to convert from hex to decimal values and then apply a shift to see that this would work. I struggled to figure out how I would go from dingbat to number but with some research I figured out that codePointAt would help me do so. I then did the conversions to decimal and applied the shift to reach a functioning decrypter. |
